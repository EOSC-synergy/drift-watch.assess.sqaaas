Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

While CodeMeta provides you with a more comprehensive description, CFF is a more lightweight, good-enough approach to software (with built-in support by GitHub) citation. Both provide tools (<a href=\"https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/\" target=\"_blank\">CodeMeta generator</a>, <a href=\"https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/#/\" target=\"_blank\">CFFINIT</a>)to easily generate a working citation file.
